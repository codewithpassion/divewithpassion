                            The year 2006 changed my life. On a trip to Australia
                            I became a SCUBA diver. Coming from a land locked country, with 
                            no one in the family that was a diver, it seemed an odd choice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years I racked up dives, was diving year round in the Swiss lakes and I became a dive instructor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, I'm living in Australia and traveling the world to document the underwater world and the environments connected to it.
